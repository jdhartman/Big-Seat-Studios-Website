	<div class="about"> 
		Big Seat Studios was founded in December of 2015. Since then, we have been a development team of two. We have started our company with the passion to make games that we would play. Our goal is to create engaging experiences for our fans and a sense of personality within our games.  While we are not a big, fancy game studio (our name can be a little misleading), we know what we like in games and we put our heart and soul into the products we make.

		Chicken Hero is a simple, yet engaging, pixel platformer based around one chicken's quest to reclaim his stolen eggs.  Chicken Phil, our protagonist, loves his family above all and will stop at nothing to reclaim what he put into this world.  Guide him through his journey of loss, redemption, and justice.
